"""Render the rational graph of a term by tabling ``weak_head_normalize`` directly.

The graph of a term is the part of the coalgebra ``(nodes, weak_head_normalize)`` reachable from it;
there is no separate readout structure to build. ``render`` walks ``weak_head_normalize`` from the root,
tabling closed nodes by identity (interning makes that a pointer test), and prints the graph with
explicit back-references for cycles:

- ``fold_cycles=True`` is the least fixpoint: a closed node re-entered during its own descent folds
  to a back-reference ``#N``, so a guarded cycle prints as a finite cyclic graph. Its only leaves
  are variables and the meaningless ``⊥``.
- ``fold_cycles=False`` is the finite-budget first iterate ``T \\uparrow 1``: a re-entry is cut to a
  distinct ``∅`` leaf (a productive cycle the budget stopped), kept separate from ``⊥`` (an
  unproductive cycle, a node with no constructor).

The fold/cut is taken only at CLOSED nodes, so a back-reference never misreads a free de Bruijn
variable; open subnodes are reprinted.
